# Grandps's Gift List
**ðŸŽ¯ JavaScriptmas 2024 challenge from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/ "target=_blank"), Day 1**

### Backstory:
ðŸ“‹ Grandpa has a Christmas wish list to keep track of all the gifts he wants to ask for. But thereâ€™s a problem: if he forgets heâ€™s already added something, the list gets clogged up with duplicates. This happened last year, and he ended up with 8 talking picture frames on Christmas Day!

So, we 'gotta make sure Grandpa's gift list is free of duplicates. Let's get started!

### Branches:
